** Points Lab **

In this assignment, you will complete 3 programs and write one from scratch.  You will also answer some questions.

1.  Read the PointersLab.pdf for exact instructions for this assignment.
2.  Edit PreLab.txt so it has the correct answers.
3.  Write each of the programs as directed in the pdf.  As always, make sure to document your code well as needed.

**Note: ** To compile each of the programs, you have to use **c++**.  For example, to compile and run **main.cpp** you would type:

\> **c++ main.cpp -o main**  
\> **./main**

You also have the option of using Clang, but I leave that up to you.
